# Doppler-Velocity-Meter

The objective was to test the capacity of a modified HC-SRO4 Ultrasonic distance sensor to function as a Doppler velocity meter that is driven by an MSP430 microcontroller. The sensors’ main controller was removed while the transducers that emit the sound waves and the receivers that listen for the echo were repurposed by adding an exclusive or-gate to detect any phase difference. The MSP430 microcontroller ran flashed assembly code that instructed the on-chip pulse width modulator to emit the initial wave and converted phase difference with the echo into a velocity as in the Doppler Effect formula. Repeated measurements were transmitted to a host computer via USB for graphing and storage via a Python program. The velocity meter was unreliable, highly susceptible to noise and only functional within a small range of 2 – 20 cm with large errors of up to ± 5cm/s. The HC-SCR04 proved a bad candidate for sensors in this particular application.
